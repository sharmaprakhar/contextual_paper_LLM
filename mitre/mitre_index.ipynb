    "In this attack, the adversary exploits the lack of rate-limiting on the number of failed security mode procedures to desynchronize the UE's uplink NAS counters. The impacts of the attack are prolonged desynchronization and denial of service (DoS) between the UE and the AMF. The adversary knows the victim UE's C-RNTI and can inject an arbitrary number of invalid sec_mode_command messages to the victim device, which induces the UE to send sec_mode_reject messages as a response while incrementing its uplink sequence number (seque ul) and overflow counter (ocue ul). As a result of this desynchronization, the legitimate AMF will discard any uplink messages sent from the victim UE, allowing the adversary to carry out a prolonged DoS and service disruption.\n",
